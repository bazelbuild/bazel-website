# Contributing to Bazel

There are many ways to help the Bazel project and ecosystem.

## Provide feedback

As you use Bazel, you may find things that can be improved. You can help by:

   - Reporting bugs. In particular, it's important to report any crash or
     correctness bug.
   - Reporting issues when the documentation is incomplete or unclear.
   - Reporting issues when an error message could be improved.

## Participate in the community

You can engage with the Bazel community by:

   - Answering questions [on Stack Overflow](
     https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/bazel).
   - Helping other users [on Slack](https://slack.bazel.build).
   - Improving documentation or [contributing examples](
     https://github.com/bazelbuild/examples).
   - Sharing your experience or your tips, for example, on a blog or social media.

## Contribute code

You can contribute to the Bazel ecosystem by:

   - Helping rules maintainers by contributing pull requests.
   - Creating new rules and open-sourcing them.
   - Contributing to Bazel-related tools, for example, migration tools.
   - Improving Bazel integration with other IDEs and tools.


### How can I contribute to Bazel source code?

Bazel is a large project and making a significant change to Bazel source code
can be difficult. Please check with us on the [dev list](
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bazel-dev) or on a GitHub issue before
investing a lot of time in a patch.

In general, we prefer contributions that fix bugs or add features (as opposed to
stylistic, refactoring, or "cleanup" changes). When making a change, please
include tests and documentation, and keep in mind backward-compatibility,
portability, as well as the impact on memory usage and performance.

See [getting started](basics/getting_started.html) for learning how to work on the
code base.
