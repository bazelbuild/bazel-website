# Guide for Bazel Maintainers

This is a guide for the maintainers of the Bazel open source project.

If you are looking to contribute to Bazel, please read [Contributing to
Bazel](/contributing.html) instead.

The objectives of this page are to:

1. Serve as the maintainers' source of truth for the projectâ€™s contribution
   process.
1. Set expectations between the community contributors and the project
   maintainers.

Bazel's [core group of contributors](/governance.html) has dedicated subteams to
manage aspects of the open source project. These are:

* **Release Process**: Manage Bazel's release process.
* **Green Team**: Grow a healthy ecosystem of rules and tools.
* **Developer Experience Gardeners**: Encourage external contributions, review issues
  and pull requests, and make our development workflow more open.

## Releases

* [Release Playbook](https://github.com/bazelbuild/continuous-integration/blob/master/docs/release-playbook.md)
* [Testing local changes with downstream projects](https://github.com/bazelbuild/continuous-integration/blob/master/docs/downstream-testing.md)

## Continuous Integration

Read the Green team's guide to Bazel's CI infrastructure on the
[bazelbuild/continuous-integration](https://github.com/bazelbuild/continuous-integration/blob/master/buildkite/README.md)
repository.

## Lifecycle of an Issue

1. A user creates an issue using the [Issue
   Template](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/master/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md)
   and it enters the pool of [unreviewed open
   issues](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+-label%3Auntriaged+-label%3Ap2+-label%3Ap1+-label%3Ap3+-label%3Ap4+-label%3Ateam-Starlark+-label%3Ateam-Rules-CPP+-label%3Ateam-Rules-Java+-label%3Ateam-XProduct+-label%3Ateam-Android+-label%3Ateam-Apple+-label%3Ateam-Configurability++-label%3Ateam-Performance+-label%3Ateam-Rules-Server+-label%3Ateam-Core+-label%3Ateam-Rules-Python+-label%3Ateam-Remote-Exec+-label%3Ateam-Local-Exec+-label%3Ateam-Bazel).
1. A member on the Developer Experience (DevEx) subteam rotation reviews the
   issue.
   1. If the issue is **not a bug** or a **feature request**, the DevEx member
      will usually close the issue and redirect the user to
      [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/bazel) and
      [bazel-discuss](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bazel-discuss) for
      higher visibility on the question.
   1. If the issue belongs in one of the rules repositories owned by the community,
      like [rules_apple](https://github.com.bazelbuild/rules_apple), the DevEx
      member will [transfer this issue](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/managing-your-work-on-github/transferring-an-issue-to-another-repository) to the correct repository.
   1. If the issue is vague or has missing information, the DevEx member will
      assign the issue back to the user to request for more information before
      continuing. This usually occurs when the user does not follow the [Issue
      Template](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/master/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md).
1. After reviewing the issue, the DevEx member decides if the issue requires
   immediate attention. If it does, they will assign the **P0**
   [priority](#priority) label and an owner from the list of team leads.
1. The DevEx member assigns the `untriaged` label and exactly one [team
   label](#team-labels) for routing.
1. The DevEx member also assigns exactly one `type:` label, such as `type: bug` 
   or `type: feature request`, according to the type of the issue.
1. For platform-specific issues, the DevEx member assigns one `platform:` label,
   such as `platform:apple` for Mac-specific issues.
At this stage, the issue enters the pool of [untriaged open
issues](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Auntriaged).

Each Bazel subteam will triage all issues under labels they own, preferably on a
weekly basis. The subteam will review and evaluate the issue and provide a
resolution, if possible. If you are an owner of a team label, see [this section
](maintainers-guide.html#my-team-owns-a-label-what-should-i-do) for more
information.

When an issue is resolved, it can be closed.

## Lifecycle of a Pull Request

1. A user creates a pull request.
1. If you a member of a Bazel team and sending a PR against your own area,
   you are responsible for assigning your team label and finding the best
   reviewer.
1. Otherwise, during daily triage, a DevEx member assigns one
   [team label](#team-labels) and the team's technical lead (TL) for routing.
   1. The TL may optionally assign someone else to review the PR.
1. The assigned reviewer reviews the PR and works with the author until it is
   approved or dropped.
1. If approved, the reviewer **imports** the PR's commit(s) into Google's
   internal version control system for further tests. As Bazel is the same build
   system used internally at Google, we need to test all PR commits against the
   internal test suite. This is the reason why we do not merge PRs directly.
1. If the imported commit passes all internal tests, the commit will be squashed
   and exported back out to GitHub.
1. When the commit merges into master, GitHub automatically closes the PR.


## My team owns a label. What should I do?

Subteams need to triage all issues in the [labels they own](#team-labels),
preferably on a weekly basis.

### Issues

1. Filter the list of issues by your team label **and** the `untriaged` label.
1. Review the issue.
1. Identify a [priority level](#priority) and assign the label.
  1. The issue may have already been prioritized by the DevEx subteam if it's a
     P0. Re-prioritize if needed.
  1. Each issue needs to have exactly one [priority label](#priority). If an
     issue is either P0 or P1 we assume that is actively worked on.
1. Remove the `untriaged` label.

Note that you need to be in the [bazelbuild
organization](https://github.com/bazelbuild) to be able to add or remove labels.

### Pull Requests

1. Filter the list of pull requests by your team label.
1. Review open pull requests.
  1. **Optional**: If you are assigned for the review but is not the right fit
  for it, re-assign the appropriate reviewer to perform a code review.
1. Work with the pull request creator to complete a code review.
1. Approve the PR.
1. Ensure that all tests pass.
1. Import the patch to the internal version control system and run the internal
   presubmits.
1. Submit the internal patch. If the patch submits and exports successfully, the
   PR will be closed automatically by GitHub.

## Priority

The following definitions for priority will be used by the maintainers to triage
issues.

* [**P0**](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/labels/P0) - Major broken
  functionality that causes a Bazel release (minus release candidates) to be
  unusable, or a downed service that severely impacts development of the Bazel
  project. This includes regressions introduced in a new release that blocks a
  significant number of users, or an incompatible breaking change that was not
  compliant to the [Breaking
  Change](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q5GGRxKrF_mnwtaPKI487P8OdDRh2nN7jX6U-FXnHL0/edit?pli=1#heading=h.ceof6vpkb3ik)
  policy. No practical workaround exists.
  * Issues marked as P0 are under active development. P0 issues of type:bug
  are supposed to be updated every 1 day and be closed in 7 days.
* [**P1**](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/labels/P1) - Critical defect or
  feature which should be addressed in the next release, or a serious issue that
  impacts many users (including the development of the Bazel project), but a
  practical workaround exists. Typically does not require immediate action. In
  high demand and planned in the current quarter's roadmap.
  * Issues marked as P1 are under active development. P1 issues of type:bug
  are supposed to be updated every 1 week and be closed in 4 weeks.
* [**P2**](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/labels/P2) - Defect or feature
  that should be addressed but we don't currently work on. Moderate live issue
  in a released Bazel version that is inconvenient for a user that needs to be
  addressed in an future release and/or a easy workaround exists.
  * Issues marked as P2 are part of the actively maintained backlog. P2 issues
  of type:bug are supposed to receive an initial update within one week and are 
  considered to be re-reviewed within one quarter.
* [**P3**](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/labels/P3) - Desirable minor bug
  fix or enhancement with small impact. Not prioritized into Bazel roadmaps or
  any imminent release. May never be fixed.
  * Issues marked as P3 are not actively managed by the Bazel team. 
  Community contributions are encouraged, the Bazel team will accept PRs.
* [**P4**](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/labels/P4) - Low priority defect
  or feature request that is unlikely to get closed. Can also be kept open for a
  potential re-prioritization if more users are impacted.
  * Issues marked as P4 are not actively managed by the Bazel team. 
  We'll leave issues open as P4 if we think that there is a value to keep them
  in the backlog though. The P4 label essentially replaces the former ice-box
  label. As always, feel free to comment or add reactions to these issues.

Priorities define the priority of the work (which might be different from 
concepts like importance, relevance or severity). If issue under active development
do not receive updates, we will ping the assignees or owners and ask them to either 
update the issue or to correct the priority accordingly.
