# Bazel Configurability 2019 Roadmap

*Last verified: 2020-01-17* ([update history](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-website/commits/master/roadmaps/configuration.md))

*Point of contact:* [gregestren](https://github.com/gregestren)

*Discuss:*  [Configurability roadmap: discussion](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6431)

**This roadmap has been retired. See [here](../configuration.html) for the current roadmap.**

## Previous roadmaps

* [2018](../2018/configuration.html)

## EOY Review
*Status as of Jan 2020:*

Platforms:

* C++ rules support the new [platforms
  API](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/main/platforms-intro.html). Deferred
  [enabling](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7260) by default since
  depending Android and iOS projects
  [break](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8716).
* Java rules support the new platforms API. [Actual platform
  definitions](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_java/pull/8) remain pending.
* To enable C++ and Java support in 2020, we'll use [platform
  mappings](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/main/platforms-intro.html#how-to-use-platforms-today)
  to manage Android / iOS integration. We'll need help from project
  owners to ensure we don't break them.
* Lesson learned: global rollout is an involved cross-team effort.

User-defined configuration:

* [Starlark build
  configuration](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/main/skylark/config.html)
  is v1.0 feature-complete: the core API is working and stable.
* Some features will continue to need bake-in time
  ([example](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/10499)). We'll
  prioritize these as individual feature requests vs. a larger overarching effort.

Efficiency:

* Due to an unanticipated temporary developer squeeze, this work stalled in
  Q4 to support basic maintenance (API bug fixes, cquery support, etc.).
* As of 2020 the squeeze is over. Trimming and caching efforts will ramp up in
  earnest starting Q1.

Collaboration:

* Extensive collaboration with [Austin Schuh](https://github.com/AustinSchuh) produced [platform-incompatible target skipping](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12n5QNHmFSkuh5yAbdEex64ot4hRgR-moL1zRimU7wHQ/edit?ts=5dfbe2fe) design. Implementation help wanted!

## Goal

**`$ bazel build :all`** ***just works***, for whatever platform(s) you build for.

* Targets "know" how to build themselves. For example, an `android_binary` automatically chooses the right SDK.
* Builds don't require command-line flags.
* Any target can be built with any other. For example, a binary's *Mac* and *Linux* versions can be built in the same command.
* Dependencies can build differently than their parents. For example, a test builds helper binaries without debug symbols.
* All rule logic and related flags are user-defined. Nothing requires a Bazel release.
* Builds can target any platform or any mix of platforms. Nothing requires a Bazel release.
* These features scale well for large builds.

## Roadmap

Dates are approximate based on our best understanding of problem complexity
and developer availability. Dates represent expected availability in released
Bazel. If a feature requires an [incompatible
flag](https://docs.bazel.build/backward-compatibility.html#incompatible-changes-and-migration-recipes),
dates represent the first time the feature can be used, even if it requires 
setting the flag before it's on by default. ETAs will change, but we'll keep
them refreshed and current.

### Platforms
Also see the [Platforms Roadmap](platforms.html) for detailed priorities.

<div class="padbottom"></div>
<span class="etabox">Jun 2019</span>**C++ rules fully support
[platforms](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/main/platforms.html) and
[toolchains](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/main/toolchains.html)**
<span class="inprogressstatus">PARTIALLY DONE</span> ([#6516](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6516))

* This gives them first-class Starlark support, `select()` [on
platforms](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/main/be/general.html#config_setting.constraint_values),
and configuration via
[-\-platforms](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/main/platforms.html#specifying-a-platform-for-a-build)
* Sets best practices for adding platform and toolchain support to other rules


<div class="padbottom"></div>
<span class="etabox">Jun 2019</span>**Java rules fully support
[platforms](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/main/platforms.html) and
[toolchains](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/main/toolchains.html)**
<span class="inprogressstatus">PARTIALLY DONE</span> ([#6521](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6521))

<div class="padbottom"></div>
<span class="etabox">Jun 2019</span>**There's _one_ standard way to select platforms
at the command line**
[see status](https://bazel.build/roadmaps/platforms.html#replace---cpu-and---host_cpu-flags) ([#6518](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6518))

* `$ bazel build //a:myrule --platforms=@bazel_tools/platforms:mac`
* `--cpu`, `--host_cpu`, `--crosstool_top`, `--javabase`, `--apple_crosstool_top`, etc. are deprecated


<div class="padbottom"></div>
<span class="etabox">Jun 2019</span>**Legacy flags like `--cpu` automatically set `--platform` while the former are removed**
<span class="donestatus">DONE</span> ([w/ opt
in](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/main/platforms-intro.html#platform-mappings))
([#6426](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6426))

* This prevents `.bazelrc`s, `select()`s on `--cpu`, and legacy command lines from breaking as rules adopt platforms
* Rules can get platforms' benefits without having to wait on migration

<div class="padbottom"></div>
<span class="etabox">Aug 2019</span>**All supported Bazel rules support 
[platforms](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/main/platforms.html) and
[toolchains](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/main/toolchains.html)**
<span class="inprogressstatus">DONE FOR PYTHON</span>

* Python: [#7375](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7375)

<div class="padbottom"></div>
<span class="etabox">late 2019</span>**Flagless multiplatform builds
(unoptimized)**
<span class="notstartedstatus">NOT STARTED</span> ([#6519](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6519))

* ```sh
        $ cat a/BUILD
        cc_binary(name = "app_for_linux", platforms = ["//platforms:linux"])
        cc_binary(name = "app_for_mac", platforms = ["//platforms:mac"])

        $ bazel build //a:all # No command line flags!
  ```
* *Unoptimized* means [memory and performance](#efficiency) issues may not be resolved

### User-Defined Build Settings
See [Starlark Build Configuration](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vc8v-kXjvgZOdQdnxPTaV0rrLxtP2XwnD2tAZlYJOqw/edit?usp=sharing) for in-depth motivation and design.

<div class="padbottom"></div>
<span class="etabox">Mar 2019</span>**Starlark supports custom configuration transitions**
<span class="donestatus">DONE</span> ([#5574](http://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/5574#issuecomment-458349702))

* Rule designers can have rules change their flags or their dependencies' flags
* This may have [memory and performance](#efficiency) consequences


<div class="padbottom"></div>
<span class="etabox">Jul 2019</span>**Starlark supports [fancy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VIRx06cZB4wLU-ASq1XKFHmx67yfHtNOCbCempaPeaA/edit) transitions**
<span class="donestatus">DONE</span> ([#5574](http://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/5574))

* Transitions can read a rule's attributes to determine what to change
* Transitions on a rule can read attributes with `select()`


<div class="padbottom"></div>
<span class="etabox">Jul 2019</span>**Starlark supports user-defined build settings**
<span class="donestatus">DONE</span> ([#5577](http://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/5577))

* A standard API defines how to declare custom settings. This consolidates [command
  line
  flags](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/main/command-line-reference.html),
  ["secret"
  flags](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/master/src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/rules/apple/AppleCommandLineOptions.java#L246),
  [--define](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/b3cf83cd20f30d77e6768de651a3e652f86d6f78/src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/analysis/config/BuildConfiguration.java#L423),
  [--features](https://source.bazel.build/bazel/+/master:src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/analysis/config/BuildConfiguration.java;l=835?q=file:BuildConfiguration.java),
  and [feature
  flags](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/d6a98282e229b311dd56e65b72003197120f299a/src/test/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/rules/android/AndroidBinaryTest.java#L3107)).

* All hard-coded Bazel flags can be migrated to this API. Actual migration may
  not have begun.
* End users (i.e. non-rule designers) can't customize settings. For end users, we want to start
  by seeing how far we can get with [`--platforms`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/main/platforms.html#specifying-a-platform-for-a-build) and [feature
  flags](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/d6a98282e229b311dd56e65b72003197120f299a/src/test/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/rules/android/AndroidBinaryTest.java#L3107).


<div class="padbottom"></div>
<span class="etabox">Jul 2019</span>**All native Bazel rules can be implemented
in Starlark**
<span class="donestatus">DONE</span> ([#5578](http://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/5578))

* This automatically comes out of user-defined build settings and custom transitions


### Efficiency

<div class="padbottom"></div>
<span class="etabox">May 2019</span>**An experimental Bazel mode automatically
shrinks build graphs**
<span class="donestatus">DONE</span> ([#6524](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6524))

* No rule builds twice when unrelated flags change
* Building the *Mac* and *Linux* versions of a binary at the same time doesn't double the build graph

<div class="padbottom"></div>
<span class="etabox">Jul 2019</span>**This mode automatically optimizes [test
trimming](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/5579) and [feature flags](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/d6a98282e229b311dd56e65b72003197120f299a/src/test/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/rules/android/AndroidBinaryTest.java#L3107)**
<span class="inprogressstatus">PARTIALLY DONE</span> ([#6524](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6524))

* No rule builds twice when unrelated flags change
* Building the *Mac* and *Linux* versions of a binary at the same time doesn't double the build graph


<div class="padbottom"></div>
<span class="etabox">Jul 2019</span>**An experimental Bazel mode makes identical actions unique**
<span class="inprogressstatus">PARTIALLY DONE</span> ([#6526](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6526))

* Stops different actions from writing to the same path and overwriting each other's output
* Improves multiplatform build time and remoe execution caching
* Makes pure Java compilation cacehable across different CPUs.


<div class="padbottom"></div>
<span class="etabox">Jul 2019</span>**Projects can selectively opt into automatic shareable actions**
<span class="notstartedstatus">NOT STARTED</span> ([#6526](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6526))

* Exposes the benefits of experimental unique actions while recognizing complete migration may take time


<div class="padbottom"></div>
<span class="etabox">Jul 2019</span>**Documentation explains how to use
[configuration transitions](#user-defined-build-settings) efficiently**
<span class="notstartedstatus">NOT STARTED</span> ([#6525](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6525))

* Explains why builds may use more memory and be slower
* Explains how to minimize this and make informed use of these features
* Points to tools for profiling your build
* Explains ongoing work to automatically improve efficiency


<div class="padbottom"></div>
<span class="etabox">late 2019</span>**Bazel automatically shrinks graphs with
mixed build settings**
<span class="notstartedstatus">NOT STARTED</span> ([#6524](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6524))
