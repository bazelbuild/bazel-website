          <h3>Tweag</h3>
          <p>
          Tweag I/O is one of Bazel's earliest adopters and has been
          an active contributor of new features and new extensions
          since early 2018. They now help others succeed in switching
          to Bazel. Tweag’s engineers and scientists bring rich Bazel
          skills plus complementary expertise that spans language design,
          software verification, data science, and more.  Together with
          Nix, Bazel is integral to delivering byte-for-byte reproducible,
          composable software systems integrated from hundreds of
          sources. <a href="https://www.tweag.io/">Learn more</a>
