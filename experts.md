          <h3>Tweag</h3>
          <p>Tweag I/O is one of Bazel's earliest adopters, an active contributor of new features and new <a 		href="https://github.com/tweag?q=bazel" target="_blank">open source extensions</a> since early 2018. Our specialty: partner with you to help you achieve near byte-for-byte reproducibility, fully traceable all the way to production and conveniently auditable builds that can be cached correctly and run fast. Tweag engineers combine extensive knowledge of Bazel with a capacity for deep technical understanding of your architecture, because no two builds are the same. We get you ready for Bazel with our <a href="https://tweag.io/bazel#ready" target="_blank">Bazel Readiness Assessment</a>, perform migrations, and improve existing setups.</p>
