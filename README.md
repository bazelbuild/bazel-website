# Legacy Bazel website

This repository hosts the contents of the **legacy** Bazel website. Right now its only purpose is to host old design docs, which we'll eventuall port over to the new site.

If you want to make changes please look here instead:

- The source files of https://bazel.build/ live at https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/tree/master/site/en
- The [Bazel blog](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-blog) is a separate GitHub repository.
