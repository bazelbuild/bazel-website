# Design Documents

The list of design documents is published on the [Bazel Proposals Repository](https://github.com/bazelbuild/proposals).

## Design Process

In order to add, change, or remove a user-facing feature Bazel, a design process is required:

1. Design is reviewed
2. Design document is published on
   [bazel-discuss](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bazel-discuss) and
   the [Bazel Proposals Repository](https://github.com/bazelbuild/proposals)
3. Design is approved
4. Design is implemented

It's possible that designs change as they are implemented in practice. The
published design documents capture the initial design, and _not_ the ongoing
changes as designs are implemented.

Always go to the [documentation]({{ site.docs_site_url }}) for descriptions of
current Bazel functionality.

## Skylark Design Documents

Changes to the Bazel build and extension language (Skylark) should go
through the [Skylark Design Process](/designs/skylark/skylark-design-process.html).
